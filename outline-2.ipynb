    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "My project is about the spontanous occurance of atherosclerosis in birds. We have conducted a systematic review of the reported cases of spontanous atherosclerosis in birds. We have searched for the term \"{aherosclerosis OR arteriosclerosis} AND {bird* OR avian}\" in web of science, and we have received 1722 search results.We have screened the papers for cases of spontanous atherosclerosis. We have found 105 papers that mention occurance of spontanouse atherosclerosis in birds. We have collected the papers, species name and the order of the bird in each citation, whether athero was induced, whether the animals were captive and whether there is a mention of succeptibility or resistance to athero in each citation. We want to visualize a phylogenitic map of occurance of atherosclerosis in birds to understand the evolution of athero in birds and the models of bird resistance or succeptibility to atherosclerosis.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "This research takes an evolutionary medicine approach to the question of occurance of one of the most common and fatal \"human\" dieases in animals (finnlayson 1962). Although the evolution of atherosclerosis in birds has not been explored in literature, other comparative studies have taken this approach for other diseases. For instance, blumstein et al. (2015), have studies the capture myopathy in hooved mammals. Abbeglen et al. (2015) have found a mechanism for cancer resistence in elephants in a similar comparative approach.\n",
    "The succeptibility or resistence found in parituclar avian groups can reveal inherent evolutionary causes of athero in humans, which can provide valuable insight into how evolution has shaped the factors that has increased humas's scucceptibility to atherosclerosis.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The aim of the project is to make ancestral reconstruction of succeptibility to spontanouse atherosclerosis in birds. I then want to visualize the phylogenetic map of spontanouse atherosclerosis in birds and determine whether the differences in occurance of athero in different avian orders represent inherent succeptibility or resistance in particular bird orders. \n",

    "# Limitations\n",
    "Sampling of characters within the birds phylogeny results in the reconstruction of atherosclerosis evolution. However, missing data has an important effect on ancestral state reconstruction and estimates of atherosclerosis evolution. Because most species of birds have not been sampled for the presence or absence of spontanouse atherosclerosis mainly due to the bias for studying certain species (i.e. chicken, turkey, pigeon) in the literature, the results are greatly affected. Absence of evidence is not simply the evidence of absence, even thought the data is being used in this fashion. Ultimately, the limitations should be taken into considerations when discussing the results."

    "Although limitations of this study, namely the missing data that affects ancestral state reconstruction and estimates of atherosclerosis evolution should be considered when discussing the results, three different methods of ancestral reconstruction (ER, ARD and stochastic charachter mapping) demonstarte interesting results. For example, all three methods estimate multiple instances of convergent evolution in different avian orders. In addition, all three methods estimate a very low probability of occurance of spontanouse atherosclerosis in bird ancestors. This indicates that some bird lineages might have evolved succeptibility to atherosclerosis during their evolution. The reason might be that evolution of some life-history traits have increased the succeptibility of birds to atherosclerosis. Finding those life-history traits that have evolved in birds with athersclerosis can provide valuable insight into factors that increase succeptibility to atherosclerosis in humans."
