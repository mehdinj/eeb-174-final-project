Project: Spontanouse occurance of avian atherosclerosis.

My project is about the spontanous occurance of atherosclerosis in birds. Occurance of atherosclerosis is high among mammals and birds.
We have conducted a systematic review of all reported cases of spontanous atherosclerosis in birds. 

The aim of the project is to first visualize the phylogenetic map of spontanouse atherosclerosis in birds and determine whether the 
differences in occurance of athero in different avian orders represents inherent succeptibility or resistance in particular bird orders. 
Finally I will analyze the relationship between various potential factors such as body mass, captivity and 
average flight altitude, and ocrrurance of spontanouse atherosclerosis. 

This research take an evolutionary medicine approach to the question of occuranc of the most common and fatal "human" diease in animals. 
The succeptibility or resistence found in parituclar avian groups can point to the inherent evolutionary causes of athero in humans, which 
can provide valuable insight into how evolution has shaped the facotrs that has increased humna's scucceptibility to atherosclerosis.
